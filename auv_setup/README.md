## AUV setup

This package contains global configs and the main launchfiles. The reason for putting these in a separate package is to be able to reach the aforementioned files from anywhere.

### Config
The config folder contains physical parameters related to the AUV and the environment

* environments: Atmosphere, water density, gravity etc..
* robots: Any and all physical constants directly related to the AUV body
* thrusters: Thruster configs for different thruster types
